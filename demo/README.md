# Demo

The demo uses streamlit to create a dashboard. After running the installation as described in the main repo, install streamlit and matplotlib:

```
pip3 install streamlit matplotlib
```

To run the dashboard:

```
streamlit run demo_quantized_dash_risky.py
```

This will generate two links (local and network) from which you can view the dashboard. Open a link in your browser and interact with the model!
